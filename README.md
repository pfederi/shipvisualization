## 🔧 How It Works

### Route Loading

The app loads ship routes from GeoJSON files (e.g., `public/data/zurichsee.geojson`) that contain maritime route data:

#### GeoJSON Creation

The GeoJSON file was created using **Overpass Turbo** (https://overpass-turbo.eu/), a web-based data mining tool for OpenStreetMap:

1. **Data Source**: 
   - Routes are extracted from OpenStreetMap's OpenSeaMap layer
   - OpenSeaMap contains detailed maritime navigation data including ferry routes
   - Routes are marked as `route=ferry` in OpenStreetMap

2. **Export Process**:
   - Used Overpass Turbo to query ferry routes in the Lake Zurich area
   - Query filters for routes with `route=ferry` tag within the lake boundaries
   - Exported results as GeoJSON format
   - The exported file contains `LineString` and `MultiLineString` geometries

3. **Route Properties**:
   - Each route includes metadata:
     - `name`: Route name (e.g., "3732: Personenfähre Thalwil - Küsnacht - Erlenbach")
     - `ref`: Course number reference
     - `@id`: OpenStreetMap relation/way ID
   - Coordinates are stored in GeoJSON format `[longitude, latitude]`

```javascript
[out:json][timeout:25];
{{geocodeArea:zürichsee}}->.searchArea;

(
  way["route"="ferry"](area.searchArea);
  relation["route"="ferry"](area.searchArea);

  node["amenity"="ferry_terminal"](area.searchArea);
  way["amenity"="ferry_terminal"](area.searchArea);
  relation["amenity"="ferry_terminal"](area.searchArea);
);

out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```

#### GeoJSON Processing

1. **Loading**:
   - Loads `LineString` and `MultiLineString` geometries from the file
   - Converts coordinates from `[longitude, latitude]` (GeoJSON format) to `[latitude, longitude]` (Leaflet format)
   - Extracts route metadata (name, ref, course numbers) from properties
   - Each route segment is stored with its coordinate path

2. **Route Storage**:
   - Routes are cached server-side for 24 hours using Next.js `unstable_cache`
   - Routes are loaded once on application start
   - Each route contains an array of coordinates forming the path
   - `MultiLineString` geometries are split into separate route segments

### Route Matching

When a ship travels between two stations, the app finds the best matching route from the GeoJSON data:

1. **Proximity Search**:
   - Finds the nearest point on each route to the departure station
   - Finds the nearest point on each route to the arrival station
   - Uses Haversine formula to calculate distances

2. **Scoring System**:
   - **Ideal Match**: Both stations within 500m of route endpoints (highest priority)
   - **Good Match**: Both stations within 1km of route endpoints
   - **Fallback Match**: Both stations within 5km of route endpoints
   - **Semantic Bonus**: Route name contains station names or course number
   - **Course Number Bonus**: Route metadata matches the ship's course number

3. **Route Selection**:
   - Selects route with best combined score (distance + semantic matching)
   - Automatically determines route direction (forward or reverse)
   - Extracts the segment between the matched points

4. **Fallback**:
   - If no route is found, uses linear interpolation between stations
   - This should rarely happen if GeoJSON data is complete

### Position Calculation

Ship positions are calculated based on timetable data and route geometry:

1. **Timetable Data** from `transport.opendata.ch`:
   - Departure time from origin station
   - Arrival time at destination station
   - Pass list with all intermediate stops and their times
   - Course numbers for route matching

2. **Time-Based Progress**:
   - Calculates elapsed time since departure
   - Calculates total journey duration
   - Determines progress ratio (0.0 = departure, 1.0 = arrival)

3. **Non-Linear Speed Profile**:
   The app uses a realistic speed profile that accounts for slower speeds at stations:
   
   - **Phase 1 - Departure** (first 0.5km):
     - Speed: 6 knots (11 km/h)
     - Accounts for acceleration and maneuvering
   
   - **Phase 2 - Cruising** (middle section):
     - Speed: 12 knots (22 km/h)
     - Normal travel speed
   
   - **Phase 3 - Arrival** (last 0.5km):
     - Speed: 6 knots (11 km/h)
     - Accounts for deceleration and docking
   
   The progress calculation weights these phases differently:
   - Approach phases take twice as long per kilometer as cruising
   - This creates realistic acceleration/deceleration curves

4. **Position Interpolation**:
   - If a GeoJSON route is found:
     - Calculates total route distance
     - Finds the segment where the ship currently is
     - Interpolates position along the route path
     - Calculates heading (course) based on route direction
   
   - If no route is found (fallback):
     - Uses linear interpolation between stations
     - Calculates bearing (direction) from departure to arrival

5. **Station Dwell Time**:
   - Ships are displayed at stations during dwell time
   - Dwell time is calculated from arrival to next departure
   - Ships are shown at the station location with status "at_station"
   - Prevents duplicate display when ship is in transit

### Ship Deduplication & Course Number Handling

The app includes intelligent logic to prevent duplicate ship displays and correctly handle course numbers:

1. **Segment Linking**:
   - When a ship arrives at a station and departs again, the segments are automatically linked
   - The arrival time of the previous segment becomes the `arrivalAtFromStation` of the next segment
   - This ensures smooth transitions without duplicate displays

2. **Course Number Preservation**:
   - Full course numbers are preserved (e.g., "029", "2529") without truncation
   - This prevents conflicts between different courses (e.g., course 29 vs course 2529)
   - Ships are uniquely identified by `${shipName}|${fullCourseNumber}`

3. **Deduplication Logic**:
   - Ships are deduplicated based on ship name and full course number
   - Priority rules: driving ships take precedence over stationary ships
   - When multiple segments are active, the temporally closest one is selected

4. **Ship Name Matching**:
   - Exact matching only (no aggressive "endsWith" matching)
   - Prevents false matches between similar course numbers
   - Ensures correct ship assignment for each course

### Caching

- **Server-Side Caching**: 6 hours for timetable data (refreshes every 6 hours for new daily schedules)
- **Client-Side Caching**: 6 hours for ship names
- **Multi-Layer Cache**: In-Memory Cache + Next.js unstable_cache + Fetch Cache
- **Rate-Limiting**: Automatic retry logic for API limits

## 🎮 Usage

### Live Mode
- Shows current ship movements in real-time
- Automatic updates every 1-2 minutes

### Simulation Mode
- Time-based simulation with manual time control (always uses today's date)
- Speed controls: 1x, 2x, 4x, 10x, 100x (for fast-forwarding through the day)
- Timeline slider to scrub through the day
- Time picker to jump to specific times
- Reset button to reset to 13:32
- Automatically switches to 13:32 when entering simulation mode

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No API Keys in Code**: All used APIs are public
- **No User Data**: The app does not collect personal data
- **CORS Handling**: API proxies safely bypass CORS restrictions
- **Rate-Limiting**: Automatic limitation of API requests

## 📝 API Documentation
